        Maybe this page has been generated by a tiny Flask app
        that just loads whatever Manifest you give it on the query string

        `manifest` as a page variable is a plain IIIF P3 manifest object, 
         optionally passed through a normaliser or converter:
        
         on the server:
         possibly_dodgy_or_previous_version_manifest = fetch ( request.querystring["iiif-content"] )
         manifest = helper.normalise ( possibly_dodgy_or_previous_version_manifest ) 
    -->

    <title>{ helpers.getLocalised(manifest.label) }</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>{ helpers.getLocalised(manifest.label) }</h1>

    {% for canvas in manifest["items"] %}
        <p>{ helpers.getLocalised(canvas.label) }</p>
        <!-- 
            Assumes that canvas.id is not dereferenceable, 
            so need to give it the manifest.id

            Remember that canvaspanel is a client side component - 
            we couldn't give it canvas={ canvas }, it needs to load from scratch
        -->
